# Structured Data Track using Rasa Chatbot

## Overview

The Structured Data Track using Rasa Chatbot project focuses on creating a conversational interface powered by Rasa to interact with and extract information from structured datasets. This project aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly way to query and manipulate data using natural language through a chatbot.

With the increasing demand for efficient data interaction tools, a chatbot powered by Rasa offers a novel approach to navigating and extracting insights from structured datasets. Users can engage in conversations with the chatbot to retrieve specific information, perform data analysis tasks, and receive relevant insights.

## Features

### 1. Chatbot Interface:

Integrate a chatbot interface powered by Rasa to facilitate natural language conversations for querying and interacting with structured data.

### 2. Data Integration:

Incorporate structured datasets into the chatbot's knowledge base, allowing users to seamlessly query and extract information from the data.

### 3. Natural Language Understanding (NLU):

Implement NLU capabilities using Rasa to accurately interpret user queries and extract relevant entities and intents for effective data interaction.

### 4. Query Processing:

Develop a robust query processing system to handle complex user requests, enabling the chatbot to provide accurate and meaningful responses.

### 5. Data Analysis Commands:

Extend the chatbot's functionality to include commands for basic data analysis tasks, such as aggregations, filtering, and sorting, enhancing the user's ability to derive insights.

### 6. User Feedback Mechanism:

Implement a user feedback mechanism to continuously improve the chatbot's understanding and response accuracy based on user interactions.

### 7. Integration with External Tools:

Explore possibilities for integrating the chatbot with external tools and platforms to enhance its capabilities and provide a comprehensive data interaction experience.

## Technologies Used

- Rasa
- Python
- NLP libraries
- Structured Datasets 
- Flask

## Getting Started

To get started with the Structured Data Track using Rasa Chatbot, follow these steps:

1. run requiirement.txt
2. After installing specific libraries you can also create your own enviourment
3. Currently Chatbot is modified only for given structured data but in modify according to need
4. If structured data is changed then we need to re-train our model
5. In python run interface.py to use bot.

## Usage

Currently use our example dataset only so refer given dataset for information you want to retrive using bot
